# GitHub Activity Tracker

The GitHub Activity Tracker is a Python application designed to fetch and analyze GitHub repository events to provide insights into the average time between consecutive events for each event type. This tool is useful for monitoring the activity and trends within GitHub repositories over time.

## Features

- Fetches events from GitHub using the GitHub Events API.
- Groups events by type and calculates the average time between consecutive events for each type.
- Stores statistics in CSV files for future reference, reducing the need for repeated API calls.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to input GitHub usernames and repository names.
